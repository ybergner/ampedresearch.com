    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <h2 class="text_left">Overview <br><br>The ability to design, tinker, iterate, and produce high-quality products within the school opens up new options for teachers to engage students in a project based environment. It is no surprise then that Makerspaces and Fablabs are capturing the interest of educators. What does making really mean for STEAM education? 
    <br>
    <br>
    Deep Making is a participatory design project aimed at capitalizing on the affordances of in-school makerspaces to cultivate scientific literacy through a focus on crosscutting STEAM concepts. From exploring the differences between discrete and continuous representations of time and matter to thinking deeply about stability and change in complex systems, we intend to prepare students for future learning experiences in STEAM subjects.

    <!-- KEY QUESTIONS -->

    <h2 class="text_right">Key Questions<br><br>▪︎ To what extent does completing a Deep Making module around a crosscutting concept prepare students for future learning of new, related content?<br>▪︎ To what extent does completing a Deep Making curriculum affect student attitudes towards learning science, self-efficacy in making practices, and motivation to engage in making activities?<br>▪︎ To what degree are participating teachers able to implement the Deep Making curriculum? What local factors impact teachers’ capacity to efficiently teach this curriculum?<br>▪︎ What are the outcomes for teachers participating in the Deep Making professional development program in terms of their pedagogical knowledge, their in-class practices, and their confidence in leading making activities?

    <!-- HIGHLIGHTS -->

    <h2 class="text_left">Highlights from Current Work<br><br>

    <strong>Module Development:</strong> We are currently in the process of developing the first Deep Making modules soon to be implemented in high schools in the Brooklyn area. This iterative process will involve feedback from making experts and makerspace teachers.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Experimental design:</strong> We plan to validate this design framework in our school-based makerspaces through experimental design involving performance tests of preparation for future learning.
